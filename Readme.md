**Serverless Event-Driven Cost Optimization**

A Lambda event-driven function with Python to trigger Cloud Watchâ€™s Event Bridge to fetch EBS snapshots, filter the stale resources and delete them if they are not associated with its volume to eliminate unnecessary stale resources.

This will create a Lambda function with the zipped lambda_function.py on the working directory and attach the IAM role created in the beginning. We also set the CloudWatch event to trigger the Lambda function once every 2 months.

This function will help optimise the cost by deleting the snapshots that are no longer needed and can be improved upon with any other AWS resources.
